            You are my laughter in happiness, my comfort in silence, and my strength in chaos. I don't just want you for a Valentine's Day; I want you for every single day that follows.<br><br>
            Thank you for being my peace and my home. I love you more than words can say.<br><br>
            Forever yours,<br>Chadu`
